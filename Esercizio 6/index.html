			<p>Locked inside the dark
				Where I'm suffocating deeper
				I'm just falling down
				Deeper, I'm falling down
				Blocked in every way
				I can't even choose my way
				Around I'm terrified
				I'm getting terrified
				No one here, no one, not anyone
				Nobody cares about me
				That cold look you give, that gaze you give
				Make tears in my eyes
				Somebody, take me home
				I don't wanna be alone anymore
				Every night
				That place of my dreams
				Somebody, take me there
				Getting out of the gray city
				Following the light
				To that place in our memory
				Over and over again, ekhem
				Why always me? What I do wrong?
				What am I in the rain for, in the rain for?
				Rain in my tears, pouring in my eyes
				Is it something that you sent to me? Oh no
				Oh, gonna get out of here
				Oh, go back to my dreams right now
				So tell me how to go to other side
				People cannot live alone
				Don't leave me now 
				Oh, take me home</p>
